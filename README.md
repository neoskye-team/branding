## Branding

### Usage

Please refer to the following guidelines when using the MonoGame logos:
- The neoskye logo can be used to link to the neoskye project and credit neoskye in your own works.
- The neoskye logo can be used only as a secondary brand in your own works, meaning the average viewer should know that this is not a neoskye website, project, or publication. In short, don't use the neoskye logo as your own logo.
- The neoskye logo can be printed on promotional products, such as t-shirts, as long as it's a secondary brand as described in point 2.
- The neoskye logo of your choice must be used unaltered and in original colors and typography.
- The neoskye logo cannot be used on commercial products without explicit permission of the neoskye team. Displaying the logo in your game credits is not considered commercial use.
